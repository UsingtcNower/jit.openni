jit.openni - a Max Jitter external for OpenNI middleware
Shell of it was imspired by the jit.simple example from the MaxSDK and
the MaxSDK documentation


Initially written and tested using:
- Windows 7 64-bit Service Pack 1
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Version 10.0.30319.1 RTMRel
- Hotfix for Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express - ENU (KB2455033)   KB2455033
- OpenNI 1.1.0.39 for Win32
- PrimeSense NITE 1.3.1.4 for Win32
- PrimeSense Sensor KinectMod 5.0.1.32 for Win32
- Max/MSP/Jitter 5.1.8 for Windows

Build notes-----------
- You will need to change the build's include and library directories to match
  the locations in the Max SDK and OpenNI SDK.

v0.4.1---------
- fixed several bugs in matrix_calc related to previously not updating the metadata for frames
- fixed the bug regarding alternate viewpoint bad resizing behavior of depthmap
- fixed the crashing bug that previously occurred when changing output matrix attributes
- fixed bug with unseen symptom -> now unlock all jitter matrices correctly

v0.4.0---------
- supports rgb, depth, and ir camera output
- now support more flexible matrix output formats for all generators
- supports up to 3 generators outputting matrices all configured from your XML file
- updated Win32 binary Max Jitter external

v0.3.0---------
- now fully supports output of RGB and depth maps
- added in a compiled Win32 binary Max Jitter external
- depth maps can be output in long, float32, or float64
- imagemap and depthmaps may work in many resolutions and formats, but is seldom tested in anything but 640x480.
- All valid modes (resolutions, fps, etc.) reported from SensorKinect driver do not actually work. For example, only 640x480x30 works for depth.
- when using SensorKinect driver, if you configure an alternate viewpoint in XML, the depthmap exhibits occasionally resizing

v0.2.0---------
Now supports updating generators when the object receives a bang. A good use of
the current functionality is defining an image, depth, and recording generator.
A sample XML config file is included. Sending bangs will then create a .ONI
recording file.

v0.1.0---------
Initial functionality. Able to read in an XML configuration file and initialize
the OpenNI system based on it. Includes debugging output which lists available
resolutions, depths, etc.
